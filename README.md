# The-Space-Between-Words

## Concept: [Experience this craft](https://sushanth-hebri.github.io/The-Space-Between-Words/)

Most days feel small, but they quietly become our life.
This project explores how emotion, time, and experience reveal what truly remains.

A minimalist interactive web experience that gradually reveals LOVE hidden inside ordinary life moments using synchronized music, typography, and animation.
